    For those of you who care, I've tried to make these reviews relatively spoiler free but I do
    reference certain future stylistic and tone choices in the later series. Keep that in mind when
    reading these - and don't read reviews for episodes you haven't watched!

    <summary>Episode Review</summary>
    <p>
        The very first episode of Sailor Moon. This is where it all started. And for a first
        outing, it's <span style="color: lime">really quite good.</span>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The first thing to note is the animation and visual style. A lot of people (especially those
        born after the 1990s) are big fans of the 1990s anime style, and Sailor Moon is almost
        definitely where people would first develop that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suffice to say - <em style="color: green">it is beautiful.</em> The vibrant colour palette
        pops out everywhere, creating a sense that the entire of Tokyo is in permanent summer.
        Sailor Moon is one of those early shows that had an extreme variation in animation style -
        with tens of different  animation directors varying per episode - but the first episode
        is expressive and well-animated.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The plot is fairly basic - Usagi discovers a magical talking cat who gives her the power
        to transform, and she overcomes her crybabyness through the encouragement of Tuxedo Mask
        to defeat the enemy using her Special Move of the season. The formula doesn't change
        until the plot-critical episodes, so expect this to be repeated a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        This episode introduces some side characters as well. Usagi's school friends make their
        first appearance as a key part of the plot, with the nerdy glasses guy and the regular other
        friend. Bluntly, they're forgettable (as I can't even remember their names not even 5
        minutes later) and they eventually end up on a bus for a few years anyway - they're just
        filler characters before the other four inner Senshis appear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usagi's family is also introduced, and whilst they play a bigger part throughout the
        whole of the series they quickly get dropped outside of tiny cameos later on, which is a
        shame. The episode also introduces Tuxedo Mask; who I'll get into in later reviews.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Overall, this is a great first episode to ease you in to watching the next 199 episodes.
        I give this episode a 5/5.

    <summary>Episode Review</summary>
    <p>
        This is the first filler episode of the show, and it happens to immediately step on a nail.
        It's understandable why this show needed filler; the manga wasn't actually released by
        the time the show aired, and the author had yet to even write anything further.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, this episode is one of what I consider Sailor Moon's "identity crisis"
        episodes. See, the show - at first - really couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to be a
        kids show or a show for 12-14 year olds. The plot is formulaic and repetitive, but this
        episode's midpoint starts with sexual assault and a gratuitous panty shot. Great!
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The actual plot is that a fortune teller monster created by the bad guys is causing all the
        kids who have their fortune told to lose restraint in their actions - to do "what they want"
        - and thus all become complete arseholes. The focus here is on Umino, one of Usagi's friends
        introduced last episode, who's "rebellious youth energy" consists of sexual assault on
        his teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really don't see why that was necessary or who it even appeals to. What's the message
        here? Teenage boys are one bad influence away from flipping up their teachers' skirts?
        Most filler in this show ends up with some character development of some sort - less so in
        the first series, mind - but what development is there from this?
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        As an aside, this episode also introduces the pretty bish≈çnen Motoki, Usagi's love interest
        in the show. He works at the arcade here, and Usagi is head-over-heels for him for most
        of the first half of the series. It's a shame he never really does anything and essentially
        disappears off-screen later on.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        This is certainly not the worst filler episode - that's yet to come - but it leaves a bad
        taste in my mouth. There's no real reason to watch this episode unless you're trying to
        watch them all. I give it a 1.5/5 - the .5 for Motoki.
